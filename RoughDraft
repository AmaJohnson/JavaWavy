CD JS3 Proj Redux 
Our goal: To use our new knowledge to implement a prompt that asks the user to enter a student’s expected college graduation date and then based on the entered month and year, welcome the high school or college student.
--Javascript is basically forming sentences using code to make sense hoorai--
//practice kids Phoebe and Grayson//
STEP 1: Grad year and month
[NA] Var Phoebe = NA;
{ Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior
};

[Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, SeniorYA;
[YA] Var Grayson = YA 
	{ Freshman, Sophmore, Junior, Senior};
	
Var Grad = [May2018, December2018
];

var HS = [

STEP 2:
//new adult novels//
Var NA= “You are in college”
//Young adult novels lmao// 
Var YA = “You are in high school.”

STEP 3: 
Var welcomeNAstudent = NA;
!! Var freshman, sophomore, junior, senior
Var welcomeYAstudent = YA; 
“Welcome <studentsclass>” unless YA then “You’re still a <student-class> in high school!”
Var Student = Freshman; 
Class of 2018
if (welcomeNAstudent = May2018) {
	console.log (NA, Grad) = “Welcome <student>!”
}

if (welcomeYAstudent = May2018) {
	console.log (YA, HS)  = “You’re still a <student> in high school!”
}

!! Student class stays four years? One code line
-- console.log basically = open dialog window in browser? 

STEP 4:
--Really must consult iPad notes hoorai-- 
Var welcomebygradclass = {
	GradMonth = { May
};
	GradYear =      { 2018, 2023
};
	welcome ={ 
If (2018) {
“Welcome Senior!”;}
 else (2023) {“You’re still a Junior in high school!”
};


If GradGone = December2018
If else? GradMonth GradYear?
--output-- console.log “Welcome [class]!” 


STEP 5:

Var welcomebygradclass = {
InputMonth: May
InputYear : 2018
Output: “Welcome Senior!”
Return this.InputMonth + “” + this.InputYear;
}
}
welcomebygradclass.Output();


STEP 6 (WHEN ALL ELSE IS DONE):
Test it :D

//GradMonth// User Input Month: May
//GradYear// User Input Year: 2018
Output: "Welcome Senior!"
4: if GradYear = 2018
User Input Month: May
User Input Year: 2023
Output: "You're still a Junior in high school!"
//Two outputs. GradMonth + Grad Year = welcomeClassYA/NA

How does gradclasses come into play? Prev project? 
--May23, most on iPad, didn’t want to bring yay. REGRET IT TURTLE. REGRET IT. --
